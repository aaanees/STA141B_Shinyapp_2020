# STA141B_Shinyapp_2020
my shiny app 
This is a simple shiny app called "Honeymoon in Turkey" and the way this app works is by using API link for Temperture and for 
location information such as biulding places
1- first the user choose the city that we wants to visit by selecting input$city
2- then the user choose what type of place he wants to go such as he want to check out resturants then the user select "input$type"
3- the third part is the putput limit where the user want to see the first 20 places in this city
4- then this app will printout "all or limit" as a table of location names and rating 
5- then the map will navigate to the input location and it pop up some information about each location such as phone number ....etc 
6- we can biuld on more things but this code is just a basic code in shinyapp
