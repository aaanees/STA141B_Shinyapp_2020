# STA141B_Shinyapp_2020
my shiny app 
This app called HoneyMoon in Turkey, where it pritns out a table of locations and thier rating for each city that is provided for the user.

1 - first the user Enters the input$city where the user choose the city to visit
2- second the user the place type such as resturants, zoo, hotels....etc
then the app prints out a table (limit) number of locations founded in the input$cit (http://https://abdallah-anees.shinyapps.io/STA141B_Shinyapp_2020/to/img.png)
then the map will navigate to each of the address locations and it pup up on the map the basic information for each location such as phone number, address, rate. 
on the right top side of the page we print out the temperture with the description for every input$city, and it change every time we reactivate or change the location address. 
this is the link for our app to run it http://https://abdallah-anees.shinyapps.io/STA141B_Shinyapp_2020/
